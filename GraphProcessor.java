/**
 * This class adds additional functionality to the graph as a whole.
 * 
 * Contains an instance variable, {@link #graph}, which stores information for all the vertices and edges.
 * @see #populateGraph(String)
 *  - loads a dictionary of words as vertices in the graph.
 *  - finds possible edges between all pairs of vertices and adds these edges in the graph.
 *  - returns number of vertices added as Integer.
 *  - every call to this method will add to the existing graph.
 *  - this method needs to be invoked first for other methods on shortest path computation to work.
 * @see #shortestPathPrecomputation()
 *  - applies a shortest path algorithm to precompute data structures (that store shortest path data)
 *  - the shortest path data structures are used later to 
 *    to quickly find the shortest path and distance between two vertices.
 *  - this method is called after any call to populateGraph.
 *  - It is not called again unless new graph information is added via populateGraph().
 * @see #getShortestPath(String, String)
 *  - returns a list of vertices that constitute the shortest path between two given vertices, 
 *    computed using the precomputed data structures computed as part of {@link #shortestPathPrecomputation()}.
 *  - {@link #shortestPathPrecomputation()} must have been invoked once before invoking this method.
 * @see #getShortestDistance(String, String)
 *  - returns distance (number of edges) as an Integer for the shortest path between two given vertices
 *  - this is computed using the precomputed data structures computed as part of {@link #shortestPathPrecomputation()}.
 *  - {@link #shortestPathPrecomputation()} must have been invoked once before invoking this method.
